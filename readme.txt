Automatically disable WooCommerce's checkout process after reaching a maximum number of orders.

== Description ==

While many stores would be thrilled to have a never-ending order queue, some store owners are faced with the opposite problem: how can I make sure I don't get overwhelmed by _too many_ orders?

Limit Orders for WooCommerce lets you limit the number of orders your store will accept per day, week, or month, while giving you full control over the messaging shown to your customers when orders are no longer being accepted. Once limiting is in effect, "Add to Cart" buttons and the checkout screens will automatically be disabled.

For full documentation on configuration options and available filters, please [visit the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexcess/limit-orders).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `limit-orders/` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
3. Visit "WooCommerce &rsaquo; Settings &rsaquo; Order Limiting" to configure limits and messaging

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when the order limit is reached? =

Once the maximum number of orders has been placed, Limit Orders for WooCommerce will use hooks within WooCommerce itself to temporarily mark all products as unpurchasable, remove the "Place Order" button, and disable the checkout form.

Meanwhile, a fully-customizable message will be displayed on all WooCommerce shop pages, informing customers that ordering has been paused.

= Can store owners still create orders manually? =

Yes, the order creation process through WP Admin is unaffected.

= Can the plugin limit orders based on some custom time interval? =

The base plugin defines several common intervals: hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly.

In the event that you require a custom interval, they may be registered with a few filters. [Several examples are available in the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexcess/limit-orders#adding-custom-intervals).

= Can the plugin limit orders based on category/amount/items/etc.? =

The plugin is designed to work based on the total number of orders, but as of version 1.3.0 filters have been introduced that enable developers to specify which orders should be counted against the limit.

[Documentation for these filters is available in the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexcess/limit-orders#customizing-plugin-behavior).
